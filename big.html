        BIG promises to provide moviegoers with an all-around big screen, big sound, and big experience. It was created especially to heighten the thrill of the most intense action-packed movies. With dimensions of more than 20 meters in width and 10.8 meters in height, the screen brings high-octane, heart-pounding scenes to life on a larger-than-life movie screen. It is powered by a 4K laser projector, which provides incredible visual clarity, sharpness, color accuracy, and dispersion throughout the entire screen.

 



        <br><br>A 32-channel multi-speaker Dolby Atmos surround sound system that produces clear, crystal-clear audio enhances its visual prowess. With ambient sound coming from every angle, this ground-breaking spatial audio technology captivates and completely immerses viewers in the movie. The bass of sounds and music is deeper when combined with extra subwoofers that are typical of large halls.
